# 2D Engine

By Lucas García and Adriá Ferrer.

## Features

This 2D engine is basically a shape editor. 

Start by creating your first object! You can do this by either selecting a shape and click "Add" on the hierarchy menu

Or directly click on the toolbar

Once an object is created, there is a list of attributes that can be edited, reflected in the inspector

- Name: Name which will represent the object in the hierarchy
- Active: Weather the object is to be drawn or not
- Shape: Which shape the object is
- Position: Central position of the object
- Scale: Ratio of width and height of the object
- Size: Scale of the object

- Fill color
- Stroke color
- Stroke thickness
- Stroke style: Solid, Dash or Dot

Feel free to remove any shape by selecting it on the hierarchy and clicking "remove".

If you mess up at any moment, you can click "back" or "forward" in the toolbar to do or undo your actions, as well
as in the main menu "Edit" or ctrl+z (undo) ctrl+y (redo)

Once your scene is full of beautifull shapes, you can save your project by using the toolbar or the main menu "file",
and open it again in the same way.

If you are not working in any existing project and haven't started a new one, the save button will ask you to set a file 
to save to, otherwise it will automatically overwrite it.

You can exit the app from the main menu.
